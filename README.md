# BindingNavigatorWpf

I wondering when I can't find binding navigator fpr WPF as I like to use in WinForms.
So I decided to write my own and share it.

I oriented to my needs - binding navigator for related data grid with MVVM support.

I try to write it as simple as possible that anyone can understood and use it.

In addition there is the demo application. I plan to migrate all projects to .NET Core someday.
